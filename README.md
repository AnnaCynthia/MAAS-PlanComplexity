# MAAS-SFRThelper
Tools to aid in the creation of structure patterns (spheres) or irregular stuctures (straight and bent rods) which can be evaluated or aid in the creation of treatment plans with the intention of not covering traditional PTVs homogeneously.  Spacially Fractionated Radiation Therapy aims to create hetrogenious dose distrubutions with intentionally large peak to valley ratios while underdosing a larger percentge of a traditional PTV.
TO DO (sphere lattice)
* In app PTV margin for spheres (currently disabled)
* OK/cancel option when distance between spheres is < radius * 2 (currently, just acknowledge) 
* check appropriate hex or rec spacing when throwing waring about spacing (actually below spheres do overlap, is hex spacing aaccurate?)

* hyperlink to license
* config file spash screen / expiration
* test estimating total sphere volume with formula (or lookup table) rather than finding the volume of each sphere for largest (speed up?)
* cancel button does nothing (remove?)
